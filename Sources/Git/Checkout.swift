    /// Checkout behavior flags
    ///
    /// In libgit2, checkout is used to update the working directory and index
    /// to match a target tree.  Unlike git checkout, it does not move the HEAD
    /// commit for you - use `git_repository_set_head` or the like to do that.
    ///
    /// Checkout looks at (up to) four things: the "target" tree you want to
    /// check out, the "baseline" tree of what was checked out previously, the
    /// working directory for actual files, and the index for staged changes.
    ///
    /// You give checkout one of three strategies for update:
    ///
    /// - ``none`` is a dry-run strategy that checks for conflicts,
    ///   etc., but doesn't make any actual changes.
    ///
    /// - ``force`` is at the opposite extreme, taking any action to
    ///   make the working directory match the target (including potentially
    ///   discarding modified files).
    ///
    /// - ``safe`` is between these two options, it will only make
    ///   modifications that will not lose changes.
    ///
    ///   |                                    | target == baseline               | target != baseline                    |
    ///   |------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    ///   | workdir == baseline                | no action                        | create, update, or delete file        |
    ///   | workdir exists and is != baseline  | no action, notify dirty MODIFIED | conflict (notify and cancel checkout) |
    ///   |  workdir missing, baseline present | notify dirty DELETED             | create file                           |
    ///
    /// To emulate `git checkout`, use ``safe`` with a checkout
    /// notification callback (see below) that displays information about dirty
    /// files.  The default behavior will cancel checkout on conflicts.
    ///
    /// To emulate `git checkout-index`, use ``safe`` with a
    /// notification callback that cancels the operation if a dirty-but-existing
    /// file is found in the working directory.  This core git command isn't
    /// quite "force" but is sensitive about some types of changes.
    ///
    /// To emulate `git checkout -f`, use ``force``.
    ///
    ///
    /// There are some additional flags to modify the behavior of checkout:
    ///
    /// - ``allowConflicts`` makes ``safe`` mode apply safe file updates
    ///   even if there are conflicts (instead of cancelling the checkout).
    ///
    /// - ``removeUntracked`` means remove untracked files (i.e. not
    ///   in target, baseline, or index, and not ignored) from the working dir.
    ///
    /// - ``removeIgnored`` means remove ignored files (that are also
    ///   untracked) from the working directory as well.
    ///
    /// - ``updateOnly`` means to only update the content of files that
    ///   already exist.  Files will not be created nor deleted.  This just skips
    ///   applying adds, deletes, and typechanges.
    ///
    /// - ``dontUpdateIndex`` prevents checkout from writing the
    ///   updated files' information to the index.
    ///
    /// - Normally, checkout will reload the index and git attributes from disk
    ///   before any operations. ``noRefresh`` prevents this reload.
    ///
    /// - Unmerged index entries are conflicts. ``skipUnmerged`` skips
    ///   files with unmerged index entries instead.  ``useOurs`` and
    ///   ``useTheirs`` to proceed with the checkout using either the
    ///   stage 2 ("ours") or stage 3 ("theirs") version of files in the index.
    ///
    /// - ``dontOverwriteIgnored`` prevents ignored files from being
    ///   overwritten.  Normally, files that are ignored in the working directory
    ///   are not considered "precious" and may be overwritten if the checkout
    ///   target contains that file.
    ///
    /// - ``dontRemoveExisting`` prevents checkout from removing
    ///   files or folders that fold to the same name on case insensitive
    ///   filesystems.  This can cause files to retain their existing names
    ///   and write through existing symbolic links.
